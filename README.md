# Terrain-Scanning Robot Coordination

## Overview
This project showcases an advanced algorithmic framework designed to manage the coordination of multiple autonomous robots tasked with scanning and mapping complex terrains. Developed as part of a robotics algorithms course, the system efficiently handles static and dynamic obstacles, ensuring accurate and comprehensive coverage of the target area.

## Features
* Wavefront Pathfinding: Implements a sophisticated Wavefront-based algorithm to calculate optimal paths for robots, ensuring effective navigation and obstacle avoidance.
* Dynamic Obstacle Management: Integrates real-time adjustments to robot paths in response to moving obstacles, maintaining efficiency and safety in dynamic environments.
* Multi-Robot Coordination: Manages the synchronized movement of multiple robots, optimizing their coverage and preventing collisions, even in densely populated areas with obstacles.
* Simulation & Visualization: Utilizes Python along with matplotlib and pandas for detailed simulation of robot behavior and visualization of the scanned terrain, enabling thorough analysis and refinement of strategies.

## How It Works
The core of this system is a Wavefront-based pathfinding algorithm that dynamically generates paths for each robot based on the terrain and obstacles. The algorithm adapts in real-time as robots encounter new challenges, ensuring that each robot follows an optimal path. The system also includes logic for managing the coordinated efforts of multiple robots, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the area with minimal redundancy.

## Use Cases
* Robotics Research: This project serves as an excellent foundation for studies in autonomous systems, multi-robot coordination, and dynamic pathfinding algorithms.
* Industrial Applications: Can be adapted for real-world scenarios where autonomous robots are used for tasks like environmental monitoring, search and rescue, or agricultural scanning.
* Educational Resource: A valuable tool for teaching and demonstrating advanced concepts in robotics, algorithm design, and autonomous navigation.
